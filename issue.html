    		<h1>The Issue</h1>
    		<h2>How Does Human Trafficking Happen?</h2>
    		<p>Traffickers use lies and manipulation to trap victims. They might promise jobs, relationships, or better opportunities but then exploit them. Common reasons people become victims include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Poverty: Struggling with money makes people more likely to trust false promises.</li>
			<li>Social Media: Traffickers use the internet to find and lure victims.</li>
			<li>Homelessness: People without stable housing are easy targets.</li>
			<li>Lack of Knowledge: Many people don’t know the warning signs of trafficking, so it’s harder to stop it early.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Who Does It Affect?</h2>
		<p>Human trafficking affects many different people, but women and girls are the main targets. Indigenous women and girls are especially at risk due to inequality and poverty. Homeless youth and people struggling financially are also more likely to become victims. Although big cities like Toronto and Ottawa see more cases, trafficking happens in smaller towns too. It’s a problem that hurts families, communities, and creates stress for social services trying to help.</p>
