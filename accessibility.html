        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>
          Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) standards are important because they ensure websites can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. By following these standards, we make it easier for individuals with visual impairments, mobility challenges, or other barriers to access and navigate our content. I reviewed my website and found areas where it could be improved for accessibility. For example, one key standard is providing text alternatives for images. Originally, the image on my "About Me" page didn’t have an alt attribute, which meant screen readers couldn’t describe the image to users. I fixed this by adding a short description like, "Photo of Simon Singh." This helps visually impaired users understand the content of the page. Another important standard is using color contrast to make text readable. My original design used light blue text on a light background in the navigation menu, which could be hard to read for people with low vision. I updated it to use colors that meat the WAI standards like dark text on a light background for active links and white text on a dark hover background, making it much easier to see. I also worked on making the structure more user-friendly. For instance, I reviewed the table on my "About Me" page to ensure it’s understandable for screen readers. Even small changes, like adding better borders and captions, can make a big difference. In conclusion, WAI standards are important because they help create a website that works for everyone and allow as many people as possible to access the internet.
