    <h1>Personal Reflections</h1>
	<p>I knew about human trafficking, but I didn’t realize how common and complicated it is. I’ve always heard about it in the news and kind of shrugged it off, thinking it didn’t affect me or the people around me. What surprised me the most is that it’s not always about young kids being kidnapped, like I used to think. Many victims are older teenagers, like 17 or 18 years old. I’ve wondered why they trust strangers online or agree to meet someone they don’t know. I realize it’s easy to judge, but these victims might be going through things I can’t imagine—like struggling with family problems, loneliness, or feeling like they have no other options. What also stood out to me is how social media plays such a big role in this. In many cases I’ve read about, it’s not a "traditional" kidnapping but more about kids being lured by someone they think they can trust. It’s scary how traffickers can use fake promises, like offering love, money, or opportunities, to trick them. If I had a random person approach me and say they wanted to take me somewhere, I feel like I’d run in the opposite direction. But after learning more about this issue, I’ve realized it’s not always that simple for everyone.</p>
